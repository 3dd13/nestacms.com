# Plugin directory

The core code base of Nesta has been kept fairly lean on purpose. Nesta
isn't supposed to be all things to all people; it's intended to be an
easy to grasp starting point from which your web site can grow.

We've therefore decided to keep the code base lean and clean, while
releasing less globally useful features as plugins.

If you'd like to write your own plugin, see [Writing Nesta
plugins][writing].
