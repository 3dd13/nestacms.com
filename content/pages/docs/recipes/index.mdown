# Recipes

Each Nesta Recipe shows how to approach a common task in Nesta. They
include example code that you can use in your own site, or as
inspiration for how to get the most out of Nesta.

If you've got an idea for a new recipe, we'd love to hear about it (you
can email your idea to the mailing list at <nesta@librelist.com>, or
contact [@nestacms][] on Twitter).
